### Data
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'nyc_airbnb_data.csv'`: each row corresponds to one listing on AirBnB in September 2022
    - `'data_dictionary'`: summary of field titles seen in file and it's data type
    - `'listings'`: uniquely listings available with all available data
    - `'calendar'`: listings with upcoming availabilities and date type data

### Description:
- 17 page spreadsheet
- Includes raw data (Hidden), processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, and a bar chart.
- Purpose was to determine what types of properties should be targeted for the vacation rental market, in the Manhattan borough of New York City based on available AirBnB data.

### Assumptions:
- Vacation rental listings are identified as having a minimum night stay of ranging from 1-7	
- Data reflects listings held by superhosts reviewd in the last 12 months (from September 7, 2022)	
- Listings were occupied for 87% of the calendar year
- 1 bedroom listings were most popular amongst all Hells Kitchen bedroom types
- Reviews reflective of verified stays, more reviewed = more stays	

### Process:
I first explored, filtered, and cleaned the data.
Then I created aggregations and pivot tables to determine the type of properties that should be targeted.
I performed calculations, pivot tables and charts to determine occupancy and estimated revenue.
I went a step further and chose to do an optional analysis to determine what attributes are important for a vacation rental.
Lastly I finalized formatting for the client's readability.

### Findings:
1. Top 10 attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals are as follows: Hell's Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, Nolita, Upper East Side			
2. Friday and Saturday had highest occupancy rate
3. Average Revnue for 1 bedroom in Hell's Kitchen is $88,920.92
