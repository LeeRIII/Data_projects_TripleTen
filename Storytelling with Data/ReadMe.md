### Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item

### Description:
- 8 Tableau worksheets, 1 Dashboard, and 1 Story
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and stories

### Findings:
1. "While Envelopes have the highest return rate, Copiers have the highest loss of profit. We should be considering the total cost of returns when optimizing our advertising strategy."
2. "The States with the highest number of returns have different rates of return by shipping method. Consistent returns come from Standard shipping, while first class carries the highest return rate in the 4th quarter."
3. "Standard Shipping had the highest # of orders, but also the highest # of returns." 
4. 'California had the highest return cost of all states"
5. "Standard Class shipping is not succesful in California as it is the leading pair in return cost."
