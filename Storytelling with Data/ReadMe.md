### Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item

### Description:
- 9-page Tableau Visualization and Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and stories

### Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.	
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.

### Process:
I first joined the sheets.
Then I analyzed data using visualizations to determine what is causing returns.
I built a dashboard for monitoring returns.
Lastly, I created a Tableau story to present my findings.

### Findings:
1. Returned purchases are the leading cause of declining profits at Superstore.
2. There is a positive correlation between sales and returns.
3. The technology category has the largest return rate.
4. There are several customers who have a return rate of 100%.
5. Each state had different rates of return for different sub-categories.
6. Orders made throughout the year had higher return rates depending on the month.
7. Return rates do not correlate with the amount of product sold, some of the lowest-selling products had a return rate of 100%.

### Notes for Reviewer:
As requested I provided 3 potential LoFi mockups and a template image of the dashboard with empty containers in the ZIP file and a stories draft in the Tableau file.
