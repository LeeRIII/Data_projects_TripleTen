### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 4 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 3 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed Excel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th, 2017, and June 26th, 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
    - `'restaurant'`: All restaurants who provided service to customers. Information including cuisine and cost were included.

### Description:
- This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.
- Includes KPI cards, Pie charts, bar charts, and RFM analysis.

### Process:
Learned of the problem presented in its entirety and its requirements for approval.
Chose Tableau and created my first submission, the "Decomposition Plan".
Analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards for a second submission.
Presented my findings in a report as my 3rd and final submission piece.

### Findings:
1. 57% of customers are men.
2. Overall profit dips during holy months (July-September). Profit for vegetarian options remains steady, recommendation was made to increase vegetarian options during this time period to increase efficiently of food costs.
