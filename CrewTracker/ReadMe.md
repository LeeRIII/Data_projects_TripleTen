Externship project after graduating from TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a team project designed to help a real-world company, CrewTracker Software, modernize its reporting system by migrating over 170 SAP Crystal Reports to interactive Power BI dashboards, improving data visualization and user experience for CrewTracker's clients. Due to sensitivity of the data and NDA signed, many artifacts will contain redacted images and lines of data, to protect company and client information.

### Data
CrewTracker Software's Microsoft SQL Database (CREWAI and its Dummy Database SnowTracker) on Azure Cloud (anonymized data).
-Large Database with 97 total tables with high-level relationships.

### Description:
- 171 Crystal Reports requested for conversion.
    - All Crystal reports were cataloged for future Externships/Crewtrackers Analyst Team.
    - 18 Power BI Reports completed including Merge Reports.
      
- First Responder Team (5 members, including myself): Extract data from Crystal Reports.
- Peer Reviewer - Review and validate Power BI reports.
- Power BI Conversion Team - Convert & consolidate reports, and design interactive dashboards with longevity.

### Process:
First Responder:
- Connect to CrewTracker Workstation via Remote Desktop Connection.
- Screenshot/grab Crystal Report Expected Layout.
- Screenshot/grab Crystal Reports Field Explorer Details.
- Save the exported PDF view of Crystal Reports.
- Copy SQL Query from Crystal reports.
- Copy formula field SQL parts and any linked Sub-Reports.
- Upload files into appropriate google drive

Peer Reviewer:
- X-Reference original SAP Crystal report template with Pbix file template.
- Check SQL Query for accuracy.  
- Check all formula fields have been converted to calculated fields or measures in PowerBI. 
- Check for completeness and the report is achieving the original purpose, and appropriate output.

### Results:
- Post externship, CrewTracker was able to migrate SAP Crystal Reports, a legacy reporting and dashboard tool, dependent on remote connection.
- All reports successfully converted into PowerBI ll now accessible by cloud.
- Modernization allows for more user-friendly and interactive dashboards, facilitating deeper data insights.
- CrewTracker now empowers its clients to gain a clearer understanding of their data, ultimately leading to improved decision-making and potentially higher client satisfaction.
- Estimated 4 weeks of works alleviated from CrewTracker personnel. 

### Personal Stats:
- As a First Responder I successfully Cataloged Crystal Reports = 35/43 assigned reports. 8 reports were deemed redundant or obsolete. 
- Power BI conversations Peer Reviewed = 8
